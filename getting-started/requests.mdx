title: How to Build Requests
description: How to build requests to the Flouci Payment API, including authentication with public and secret keys.
---

The Flouci Payment API is built on REST principles and requires all requests to be made over HTTPS (TLS 1.2 or higher). Any requests sent over plain HTTP will be rejected.

## Authentication

To authenticate your requests, you must include an `Authorization` header in every API call. The value of this header should be your `public_key` and `secret_key` joined by a colon, in the following format: `Bearer <PUBLIC_KEY>:<PRIVATE_KEY>`

<RequestExample>
```bash cURL
curl -X POST '@IP/api/v2/generate_payment' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <PUBLIC_KEY>:<PRIVATE_KEY>' \
```
</RequestExample>
