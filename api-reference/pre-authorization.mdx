title: Pre-Authorization
description: Pre-authorize a payment to be captured later.
---

Pre-Authorization is a payment process where a cardholder's funds are temporarily held to ensure the availability of the specified amount for a future transaction. This process involves verifying the card details and reserving the funds without actually transferring them, allowing merchants to confirm the card's validity and the customer's ability to pay. 

Once the pre-authorization is approved, the funds are earmarked and can be captured later when the final transaction is completed, providing flexibility and security for both merchants and customers in managing payments.
