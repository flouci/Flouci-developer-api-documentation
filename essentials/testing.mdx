With each developer account, you will automatically have a test application called **TEST APP**. You can use the `PUBLIC_KEY` and `PRIVATE_KEY` of the test app during the integration of the payment on your site.

### Wallet Payments

To test wallet payments, use the code `111111` for a successful transaction and `000000` to simulate an error.

### Card Payments

| Card Type   | Test Case          | Card Number     | Expiration Date | CVV |
| :---        |    :----:          |          ---:   | :---:           | ---:|
| Visa        | Successful Payment | 4509 2111 1111 1119| 12/26           | 748 |
| MasterCard  | Successful Payment | 5440 2127 1111 1110| 12/26           | 665 |
| Visa        | Successful Payment | 4242 4242 4242 4242| 12/26           | 123 |
| MasterCard  | Failed Payment     | 5471 2511 1111 1116| 11/23           | 858 |

### Transaction Verification

In the test environment, `verify_payment` keeps the transaction status information for 20 minutes. You can check the status of the transaction with the `payment_id` during this period to finalize the integration on your website.

In the test environment, the information is not visible in any dashboard, and is accessible via API only. Once you move to production keys, all transactions can be monitored in real-time via our web interface https://app.flouci.com.
