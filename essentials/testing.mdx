With each developer account, you will automatically have a test application called **TEST APP**. You can use the `app_token` and `app_secret` of the test app during the integration of the payment on your site.

### Wallet Payments

To test wallet payments, use the code `111111` for a successful transaction and `000000` to simulate an error.

### Card Payments

To test payments by bank/postal card, use the card number `4242 4242 4242 4242` for a successful transaction, and any other combination of 16 characters to simulate an error.

### Transaction Verification

In the test environment, `verify_payment` keeps the transaction status information for 20 minutes. You can check the status of the transaction with the `payment_id` during this period to finalize the integration on your website.
